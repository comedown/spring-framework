/**
 * Subinterface of AOP Alliance MethodInterceptor that allows additional interfaces
 * to be implemented by the interceptor, and available via a proxy using that
 * interceptor. This is a fundamental AOP concept called <b>introduction</b>.
 *
 * <p>Introductions are often <b>mixins</b>, enabling the building of composite
 * objects that can achieve many of the goals of multiple inheritance in Java.
 *
 * <br><br>
 * AOP联盟MethodInterceptor的子接口，它允许拦截器实现额外的接口，并可以通过使用该拦截器的代理。
 * 这是一个叫做<b>引入</b>的基本AOP概念。
 *
 * <p>介绍通常是<b>混合的</b>混，能够构建复合对象，可以在Java中实现多种继承的许多目标。
